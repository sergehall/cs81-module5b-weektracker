# REFLECTION

**Were your predictions accurate?**  
Yes, most of my predictions were close to accurate. I expected "Painting" or "Cooking" to have the highest enjoyment, and both of them scored 9, which matched my assumption. I also predicted that the "creative" category would dominate, and that turned out to be true — I had three creative activities in my week.

**What surprised you about your week?**  
I was surprised that some evening activities were actually less enjoyable than I expected. I thought evenings would show the highest enjoyment overall, but the average was a bit lower than I predicted. Also, not as many activities fit into the “low-effort, high-enjoyment” category as I thought — most of them required at least moderate time investment.

**Which higher-order function was most useful and why?**  
`filter()` was the most useful higher-order function for this project. It allowed me to extract very specific sets of data, such as activities done in the evening, or those with high enjoyment and low time commitment. I also really appreciated the flexibility of chaining `filter()` with `map()` or `reduce()` to build more powerful and readable analysis.
